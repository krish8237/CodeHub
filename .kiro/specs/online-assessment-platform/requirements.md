# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Online Assessment Platform is a comprehensive web-based application that enables educators and organizations to create, manage, and conduct various types of assessments including coding challenges, multiple-choice questions (MCQ), and descriptive questions. The platform features an integrated VS Code editor for coding assessments, detailed result analytics with export capabilities, and built-in tutorial documentation for popular programming languages. The system includes user authentication and role-based access control to support different user types including administrators, instructors, and students.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an assessment is completed THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive results including scores, time taken, and detailed breakdowns
2. WHEN viewing coding question results THEN the system SHALL display code submissions, test case results, code quality metrics, and execution statistics
3. WHEN viewing MCQ results THEN the system SHALL show selected answers, correct answers, and time spent per question
4. WHEN viewing descriptive question results THEN the system SHALL provide submitted text with highlighting and annotation capabilities
5. WHEN analyzing class performance THEN the system SHALL generate statistical reports, grade distributions, and performance trends

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to export assessment results in various formats, so that I can integrate with other systems and create reports for stakeholders.
